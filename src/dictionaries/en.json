    "main": "I am a Full Stack Developer with a foundation in Industrial Engineering. My career began in Supply Chain Management, where I spent 8 years optimizing complex operations and implementing custom ERPs. Today, I translate that systems-thinking into scalable software. Most recently, I worked at a Software Factory architecting the backend of a high-volume food delivery platform and co-developed PixMed, a SaaS solution for medical reporting. I specialize in building complex business logic, and intuitive UIs using Typescript and modern frontend and backend frameworks. I don't just write code; I engineer efficient digital solutions for real-world business problems.",
